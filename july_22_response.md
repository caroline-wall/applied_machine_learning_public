Boosted Trees:

1. A one-hot-encoded column is one in which categorical data has been transformed into numerical data, so all the features are defined as numbers for the model. The source values are discrete because they correspond to a label, meaning that there is a finite list of options.

2. A dense feature transforms the data stored in the variable example into an array of floats. This is useful as it provides uniformity in the data because each feature column now holds floats.

3.
