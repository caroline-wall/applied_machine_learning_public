1. TF Hub is a library that gives you access to parts of machine learning models and datasets. For this script, we used TF Hub to create the first layer of our neural network, which embeds a sentence and stores the embedding in a vector.

2. The optimizer and loss functions are how the model calculates its error and adjusts the parameters of each neuron from their initial random values, so the model's error decreases. The model had an accuracy of 87%, which was fairly good for how basic the model was.

This graph shows how the loss changed over the course of the epochs for both the training data and the testing data.
